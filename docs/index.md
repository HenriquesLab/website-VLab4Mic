# VLab4Mic

**A Virtual Laboratory for Microscopy**

Simulate fluorescence microscopy experiments — build virtual samples, apply fluorescent labelling, and image across modalities — before stepping into the microscope room.

## Why VLab4Mic?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-dna:{ .lg .middle } **Virtual Samples from Atomic Structures**

    ---

    Build virtual samples directly from PDB/CIF structural models and populate fields of view with particles.

-   :material-tag-multiple:{ .lg .middle } **Realistic Fluorescent Labelling**

    ---

    Model direct and indirect labelling with antibodies, nanobodies, GFP, SNAP-tags and more — including labelling efficiency and steric hindrance.

-   :material-microscope:{ .lg .middle } **Multi-Modality Imaging Simulation**

    ---

    Simulate image acquisition across Widefield, Confocal, STED, AiryScan, SMLM, and custom modalities with physically-grounded PSFs and noise models.

-   :material-chart-scatter-plot:{ .lg .middle } **Parameter Sweeps**

    ---

    Systematically test parameter combinations and compare outputs — quantify how labelling efficiency, probe distance, or exposure time affect your images.

## Quick Start

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install vlab4mic
    ```

=== "pip (with Jupyter)"

    ```bash
    pip install vlab4mic vlab4micjupyter
    ```

Then run your first imaging simulation:

```python
from vlab4mic.experiments import image_vsample

images, noiseless, experiment = image_vsample(run_simulation=True)
```
